# FAQ's

Q: Why are there no dates on your roadmap?

A: We won't provide specific dates for releases. We do however sorting tickets according to priority meaning that in every category on the roadmap.
The ticket at the top is the biggest priority.

Q: What do the roadmap categories mean?

- Just shipped - obvious, right?
- Coming soon - coming up. Think a couple of months out, give or take.
- We're working on it - in progress, but further out. We might still be working through the implementation details, or scoping stuff out.
- Researching - We're thinking about it. This might mean we're still designing, or thinking through how this might work. This is a great phase to send how you want to see something implemented! We'd love to see your usecase or design ideas here.

Q: Is everything on the roadmap?

A: Almost everything will be on the roadmap.

Q: How can I provide feedback or ask for more information?

A: Please open an issue!

Q: Why are pull requests disabled
